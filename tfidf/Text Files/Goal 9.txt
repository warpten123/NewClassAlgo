advantages asian developing economies labor natural resources capital technologies markets aim reassess industrialization strategies implemented 1950s present time including import substitution export orientation heavy industries based strategies of failed succeed two resulted miracle economic growth much vulnerable exposure foreign capital technologies markets consideration internal factors this led great economic social environmental imbalances one undeniable consequences biases current financial crisis as result asian developing economies turned development trend development strategy sustainable industrialization characterized balanced flexible economic social development greater international regional integration ecological environment 4 introduction this paper result research project entitled industrialization modernization enhancing comparative advantages experiences asian developing economies development ideas suggested occasions author beginning 1990s the leading idea research perception comparative advantage high efficiency industrialization modernization developing economy the analysis major sources comparative advantage labor natural resources capital technologies market exploited asian developing economies industrialization review industrialization strategies adopted asian developing economies import substitution export orientation heavy industry based industrialization suggests i import substitution and export orientation rapid but biased heavy industry based too heavy to move 1 market it chance narrow view point reliance played role background import substitution strategy bankrupt needed reorientation redefinition case india number developing economies even country china considered great socialist nation vast labor reservoir rich natural resources huge domestic market means hand building country developing economy regarded principle independence reliance fundamental economic construction finally admit owing prolonged seclusion world opportunities missed the technological gap china foreign countries widened absence competition international market domestic products competitive some industrial products qualitatively quantitatively improved owing limitations domestic market 1 5 a state billion people finally admit limitation domestic market this runs directly counter view china india developing economies 1950s emphasized importance domestic factors the situation posed economists developing economies question examining series problems possibilities limitations states process economic development international division labor in sixteenth seventeenth centuries international trade developed vigorously two main factors growth capitalist economy discovery lands in eighteenth nineteenth centuries classical economists demonstrated highly efficient division labor realized individuals single country also countries nations it unfortunate 1950s economists policy makers developing economies fear exploitation imperialism motivated high sense independence strong build economy lessons history underestimated opportunities brought international division labor in economies size population principal criterion determining capacity market according approach populated country larger market but developing modern industry large scale production limitations domestic markets gradually uncovered step
