examine concomitant related policy strategy project intervention purpose recommending reform possible reorientation previous study suggested poverty incidence socioeconomic status government expenditure education percentage gross domestic product gdp ratio ptr key determinant school attendance net enrollment rate except study covering specific area country related study philippine examine
