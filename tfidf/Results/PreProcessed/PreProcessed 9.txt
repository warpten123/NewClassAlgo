natural resource capital technology market aim reassess industrialization strategy implemented since 1950s present time including substitution strategy of third obviously failed succeed two resulted miracle economic growth much vulnerable exposure foreign capital technology market hence le consideration internal factor this led great economic social environmental imbalance one serious undeniable consequence bias current financial crisis a result asian developing economy turned new development trend may said new development strategy sustainable industrialization characterized balanced flexible economic social development greater international regional integration better ecological introduction this paper result research project entitled industrialization modernization enhancing comparative advantage experience asian developing economy development idea suggested various occasion author since beginning 1990s the leading idea research perception comparative advantage used high efficiency industrialization modernization developing economy the analysis major source comparative advantage labor natural resource capital technology market exploited asian developing economy industrialization review industrialization strategy adopted asian developing economy based industrialization suggests and rapid but biased too heavy to move 1 market it chance narrow view point played role background strategy either went bankrupt needed reorientation redefinition seen case india number developing economy even country china considered great socialist nation vast labor reservoir rich natural resource huge domestic market every possible mean hand building country developing economy within regarded principle independence self reliance fundamental economic construction finally admit owing prolonged seclusion outside world many opportunity missed the technological gap china foreign country widened absence competition international market domestic product become le le competitive some industrial product could qualitatively quantitatively improved owing limitation domestic market 1 5 a state one billion people finally admit limitation domestic market this run directly counter view china india many developing economy 1950s always emphasized importance domestic factor the new situation posed economist developing economy question whole series problem concerning possibility limitation state process economic development new international division labor in sixteenth seventeenth century international trade developed vigorously due two main factor growth capitalist economy discovery new land in eighteenth nineteenth century classical economist demonstrated highly efficient division labor could realized among individual single country also country nation it unfortunate 1950s economist policy maker developing economy fear exploitation imperialism motivated high sense independence strong build economy ignored lesson history underestimated opportunity could brought international division labor in economy size population taken principal criterion determining capacity market according approach populated country larger market but came developing modern industry production limitation domestic market gradually uncovered step step realized determining factor capacity market purchasing power solely population size even though latter may play important role in india instance four decade development realized population around 900 million people average annual per caput income nearly 400 u dollar 10 per cent able buy durable family consumer good radio television set air conditioner refrigerator most rest population afford buy basic need good minimum necessity food clothing people living poverty line account half population india enough money buy even item basic need in condition say world market relied upon developing economy develop domestic industry inclusive sustainable industrial development inclusive sustainable industrial development isid creating shared prosperity economic growth driven entrepreneurship continuous economic diversification growing trade relation industrial upgrading technological innovation evidence proving industrialization to many developing country successful effective poverty reduction strategy hard example become role model effectively find whether look early advance lifting large number people poverty european country united state japan caught global trend already share manufacturing latter half 20th century including republic created developing country almost doubled korea china many asian tiger past 20 year 18 percent 1992 35 dragon always industrial development percent 2012 the structural transformation trade industrial good shaped occurs economy move high reliance success agriculture natural resource extraction activity foster local related service dramatic development impact it unleashes dynamic competitive economic force generate employment income facilitate international trade use resource efficiently this experience repeated around world since original industrial revolution 18th shared prosperity 5 however really improve living standard based experience essential better woman men benefit growth integrate woman youth process creating shared equitably industrial workforce this yield positive multiplier effect household community this achieved decent employment also contributes greater social cohesion opportunity available segment labour force manufacturing industry increased participation international trade also related service sector absorb large number help improve local working condition worker provide stable job need comply international standard good benefit increase prosperity greater access modern technology best family community an efficient practice combined increased investment agriculture enhances economic stability rural household industry therefore important source decent increase food security promotes innovation employment accounting almost 500 million throughout industrial value chain job worldwide fifth world workforce only economy experience past decade show shared ability constantly generate new activity based prosperity case based progress made upgrading higher level higher absorbing labour force effectively productivity higher return scale economy industrial job characterized structural change sustain stable job increase prosperity growing share population 6 inclusive sustainable industrial development inclusive sustainable industrial development isid safeguarding environment any progress poverty eradication succeed achieving necessary economic growth within environmentally sustainable framework the importance promoting cleaner we technological capability cleaner efficient pathway production industrial production today green industry economic growth environmental degradation promoted deliver environmental good service emphasized strongly enough these industry sustainable source structural diversification job income we deny one side effect industrialization prosperity moreover committing sustainable considerable environmental footprint there production pattern make business sense reduces country yet fully resolved issue wastage costly resource contributes waste management water purification pollution increased competitiveness however experience show sound intervention manufacturing industry there also imperative increase energy efficiency highly effective significantly reduce environmental industrial production since energy input represent degradation important cost production industry clean energy energy efficiency progressively become in context drive innovation process core determinant economic competitiveness optimization core industrial upgrading sustained growth effort important mean develop necessary solution realize cleaner production efficient demanding choose industrial growth resource management reduction waste sustainability therefore
