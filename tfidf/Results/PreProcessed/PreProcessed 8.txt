productivity tends rise enterprise size small enterprise le productive large one the second characteristic small enterprises1 constitute overwhelming proportion private sector establishment normally employ 45 65 per cent workforce they important source employment developing developed country thirdly wage lower worker right condition le adequate job quality lower enterprise taken together characteristic indicate significant portion labour force many country employed small establishment worker earn lower wage fewer right worker larger enterprise this depiction small enterprise throw several important issue organize around question concern challenge the question inefficient enterprise forced market large productive firm this happen according natural process economic competition the survival firm raise important concern poor wage working condition linked lower productivity may adequate support decent living in many poor country also developed country people may working still unable move poverty this concern raise important challenge interested reducing poverty decent work the challenge find way link productivity improvement decent work virtuous cycle in cycle enhanced productivity would lead better wage benefit working condition better working condition achieved effective cooperation social institution broader process social dialogue would support higher productivity the present paper organized around three issue the question dealt first section the probable answer small large firm continue exist often compete directly very small firm notably informal economy however tend forced market competition offer better employment elsewhere economy develops the concern analysed second section review evidence regarding wage working condition reveals job quality lower small enterprise in many case people earning minimum wage we find diversity experience among enterprise owner however poor others earn would formal sector employee the challenge considered section three here suggest productivity improvement condition encouraged together may supported training effective social institution the main focus seed job quality activity example case study the bias labour productivity comparing small large enterprise much research productivity based single indicator labour productivity this measure relatively easy calculate practical sense allows comparison across time country it best measure 1 unless indicated otherwise term small paper group enterprise normally classified micro small medium the actual size enterprise varies according country definition 1 however deficiency may pose grave concern general comparison pose particular problem comparing large small enterprise productivity relationship output input it rise increase output occurs le proportionate increase input output produced fewer input in either case ratio value output quantity quality value input increased when data available input total factor productivity tfp calculated due inclusiveness complete measure it often difficult record input across sector economy however instead main input used calculate productivity the klems measure includes capital k labour energy material service one broader measure schreyer pilat 2001 labour productivity common indicator measure it result calculation value added output le intermediate component input divided amount labour it also called value added per worker despite name labour productivity increase value added rise better utilization coordination etc factor production value added may increase labour working smarter harder faster better skill also increase use better machinery reduction waste input material introduction technical innovation indeed anything raise value added raise labour productivity the term therefore correct change increase value added make worker productive slightly misleading denotes productivity general specifically relating worker why understanding labour productivity important relate issue poverty a productivity increase allows greater return factor production if increase labour productivity arises better trained better treated efficient worker support higher wage but increase labour productivity arises use additional machinery gain need pay least part machinery this mean enterprise high capital investment obliged higher labour productivity need pay additional capital statistic compare labour productivity large firm small firm normally exhibit lower capital investment contain systematic bias there another bias empirical research much work focus data gathered industrial census survey manufacturing firm manufacturing much affected economy scale service activity a large proportion small enterprise engaged service notably trading also catering repair work personal service the extent two bias affect data known requires research despite limitation labour productivity measure used paper much evidence reviewed based 1 why small enterprise driven market this section review evidence concerning productivity gap small large enterprise it considers existence gap static sense snapshot contrast important role small enterprise play providing employment the issue whether employment shift small large enterprise time also 2 or correctly number hour worked 2 considered the question title answered suggestion small enterprise survive avoiding direct competition large firm evidence gap a positive correlation enterprise size labour productivity evident across main region developing world that large firm productive table 1 indicates productivity formal smes3 ten latin american country range large enterprise over time gap decreased half country surveyed increased half suggesting regional trend data seven african country show similar result productivity rising five category see annex table a1 there anomaly though lower productivity largest size category relative second largest kenya cameroon côte ivoire this probably due large number state firm category figure four asian country including japan show consistent pattern labour productivity rising size category table a2 employment role small enterprise despite labour
