requires extra effort example many sustainable product expensive conventional product what beneficial effect sustainable consumption environmental preservation materialize time result repeated purchase many people because collective effort needed achieve sustainability individual consumer may uncertain whether purchase decision make difference this research project addressed question may motivate consumer purchase sustainable grocery despite uncertainty individual drawback associated sustainable consumption there two main objective first investigate individual characteristic may distinguish frequent buyer sustainable grocery le frequent buyer second provide insight consumer encouraged purchase sustainable grocery to end two study conducted study 1 online survey addressed first objective more precisely purpose study investigate well social value time perspective predict purchasing sustainable grocery in domain grocery purchasing individual characteristic studied together a general sustainable development explored the former refers people perceived general ability deal stressor achieve desired outcome whereas latter refers degree people feel able contribute sustainable development construct studied it assumed value time perspective high characterize consumer frequently purchase sustainable grocery consumer purchase sustainable grocery le frequently

purchasing sustainable grocery with regard people perceived ability indirectly contribute sustainable development investigated it found social value time perspective accounted part variance sustainable consumption the relation focal variable generally expected direction study 2 intervention study addressed second objective it investigated whether consumer encouraged purchase sustainable grocery help informational intervention the main focus intervention provide information individual consumer contribute sustainable development individual contribution sustainable development may encourage consumer join the effect intervention sustainable 6 development sustainable consumption purchasing intention actual product purchase assessed the participant 145 people living municipality bergen randomly assigned one two group intervention group control group the result second study reported paper 3 it found intervention strengthened intention purchase domestic seasonal product certified ecological product in addition intervention promoted actual purchasing ecological fair trade product however affected intervention thus increased preference sustainable grocery intervention group explained change in sum result research project show consumer purchase sustainable grocery regular basis tend attach importance welfare others consider future consequence action believe personally contribute sustainable development furthermore consumer encouraged purchase sustainable grocery provided information individual directly indirectly contribute sustainable development these
